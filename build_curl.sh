# --enable-websockets: WebSocket support is on by default in curl 8.23.0 (it
# was still experimental and off by default in curl 8.9.1), but pass it
# explicitly since lute's net module implements its websocket client on top of
# libcurl's connect-only mode (CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY=2 + curl_ws_send/
# curl_ws_recv), so the corpus curl must provide it.
